# IBM InfoSphere Information Server Connectors Release Notes

## Latest Release

- _None_

## Older Releases

- _None_

## Future Releases

Our master branch is currently taking code for all future releases.
We integrate code for partial function as soon as it is stable and has no
impact on released function. So you will see support for more function than is
officially released. This way you can start to experiment with unreleased
functionality and provide feedback to help steer its eventual release.
